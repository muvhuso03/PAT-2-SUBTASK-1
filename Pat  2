What is Morse code?

Morse code is a communication system that uses sequences of short and long signalsâ€”commonly referred to as "dots" and "dashes"â€”to represent letters, 
numbers, and punctuation.  Developed in the 1830s, it revolutionized long-distance communication and laid the groundwork for modern telecommunications. 

ðŸ“œ Origins and Development?

Samuel F. B. Morse, an American artist and inventor, began developing the telegraph in 1832.  By 1835, he had created a working prototype, 
and in 1837, he introduced a version of Morse code that initially represented only numbers.  Alfred Vail, Morse's assistant, expanded the code 
in 1840 to include letters and special characters, making it more versatile for general communication.  This system, known as American Morse Code,
was first used commercially in 1844 when Morse sent the message "What hath God wrought" from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore.  

In 1851, to accommodate non-English languages and standardize international communication, the International Morse Code was introduced. 
This version simplified some characters and became the global standard, especially

ðŸ”§ How It Works?

Morse code represents each character as a unique sequence of dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals).  
For example, the letter "A" is represented as ".-" and "B" as "-...". 
These signals can be transmitted through various means, including sound, light, and electrical pulses.
Operators often learn to recognize these patterns by ear, a skill known as "sound reading."  
The code's efficiency lies in its design: more frequently used letters have shorter representations.
For instance, "E," the most common letter in English, is represented by a single dot
